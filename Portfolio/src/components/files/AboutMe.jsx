                Hi! My name is Derek Hurteau. I am currently a student in a fullstack web development bootcamp. I am hoping
                to break in to the web development world after class and start my journey within the tech industry!

                I am an avid hiker and guitarist as well as a PC builder and occasional gamer. 
                Thank you for checking out my portfolio page, and if you have any questions please feel free to contact me!
        
            </p>
