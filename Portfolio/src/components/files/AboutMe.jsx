                Hi! My name is Derek Hurteau. I am currently a student in a fullstack web development bootcamp. I am hoping
                to break in to the web development world after class and start my journey within the tech industry!
            </p>
            <p>
                I am an avid hiker and guitarist as well as a PC builder and occasional gamer. My love for PC hardware and 
                PC building lead me down the path to learning how to code to get a better understanding of web and software development.
            </p>
